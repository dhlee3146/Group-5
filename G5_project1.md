+ Errors encountered before starting game activities could be resolved by refreshing the page, allowing normal game activities to begin.


# 📋 How do we utilize this digital tool in our classroom?

### + Lessons focusing on **vocabulary learning**
### + Intended Audience: 7th-grade students
### + The goal of this lesson
: Students can create and understand their own definitions of English words, and increase the effectiveness of learning English words.

### + Digital Tool: StudyStack
### + Senario for activity:
1. Students look at the word list in the textbook.
2. Then, they try to explain each word. For example, they explain the word "school" as "a place where children go to learn something.“
3. After trying various word explanations and comparing them with those of their group members, they derive the final answer and create a stack on StudyStack.
4. Afterward, share the stack link via Google Classroom or other classroom platform to make it available to the entire class.
5. You can use student‘s stacks to play crossword puzzles or matching games, allowing students to see what other groups of students have done and reviewing vocabulary words.
