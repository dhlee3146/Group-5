### It Starts from Inside of Me 

Do you find it difficult to face the new school year? If so, you are not alone. Why don’t you listen to what these two students have to say about their new school life and what four living books would like to tell them? 

Philip 
I want to do well as a high school student, and I’m more than determined to do so. Yet I have little idea what I want to do in the future. To be honest, I am not sure I can do anything well. Where should I begin? 

Director of Photography 
When I started high school, I wanted to do well but nothing went right. I had troubles with my friends and my grades suffered. I had no idea what I really wanted to do. I wanted to change, and started to reflect on myself. 

**Realizing** that I loved taking photos, I tried doing that for a month. I joined a **photography** club. I went from looking at pictures all day to actually taking them. Before long I found out what I liked and dreamed of becoming.

Why don’t you try to find something that you love to do, and then get started right away?  

First, keep an eye out for **specific** activities that you are really interested in. Make sure you are ready to take advantage of any chances available to you: sign up for programs, talk with specialists, and keep getting involved. Then stick your toe in the water and find out what your true passions are. 

Some of you might find it hard to **discover** what you really like. Then stick to your school work and pay close attention to school subjects you are better at. 


- Realize 깨닫다, 알아차리다, 인식[자각]하다
- photography 사진[촬영]술, 사진 찍기[촬영]
- specific 구체적인, 명확한, 분명한
- discover 발견하다

2. Then, they try to explain each word. For example, they explain the word "school" as "a place where children go to learn something.“
3. After trying various word explanations and comparing them with those of their group members, they derive the final answer and create a stack on StudyStack.
4. Afterward, share the stack link via Google Classroom or other classroom platform to make it available to the entire class.
5. You can use student‘s stacks to play crossword puzzles or matching games, allowing students to see what other groups of students have done and reviewing vocabulary words.
